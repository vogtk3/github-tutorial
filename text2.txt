Quotes from Big Bang Theory:

Raj: I don't like bugs, okay. They freak me out.
Sheldon: Interesting. You're afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic.

Kristen: I think bugs are cool
Maria: Noooo I don't think so. There was a cockroach in our shower last night I was not having it.

Leonard: My point is, while you're spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, 
what you're really doing is becoming interesting. When people finally do notice you, they're gonna find someone a lot 
cooler than they thought. And for those of you that were popular in high school, it's over, sorry. Thank you. Congratulations.

Sheldon: Amy's mad at me, and I'm not clear why. 
Penny: Okay, were you talking before she got upset? 
Sheldon: Yes. 
Penny: That's probably it.

Sheldon: Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, 
scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, 
rock crushes scissors.

Stuart: Oh, Sheldon, I'm afraid you couldn't be more wrong.
Sheldon: More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.
Stuart: Of course it is. It's a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable, it's very wrong to say it's a suspension bridge.

Howard: You know, I'm really glad you decided to learn Mandarin. 
Sheldon: Why? 
Howard: Once you're fluent, you'll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me.

Sheldon: This song is never going to stop.Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?
Leonard: That's a trick question, right?

Penny: Do I really force you to do things you don't want to?
Amy: Yeah, but it's okay.
Penny: How is it okay?
Amy: I promised myself if I ever got friends I'd do whatever they said. Really, I'm lucky you found me before a cult did.
